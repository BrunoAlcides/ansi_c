# ANSI-C Studies

Every code here was tested using the Dev C++ IDE. To test, you can clone that repository using the next command in your GitBash or in the terminal:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mmoraisa/ansi_c.git
```
To test the entire code you can uncomment some lines of functions and do your tests compiling and executing the program of each file std (study).
